 <h2>Ways We Can <b>Prevent</b> Child Abuse</h2>
<b> <p>We can prevent child abuse in many ways, some of which include:
 <li>Showing the public how serious child abuse truly is</li>
 <li>Informing the public the different types of child abuse</li>
 </b>
   
<ul> By showing the public how serious child abuse really is and how drastic events that happened in a child's early life
  could effect a person, hopefully the eyes of the public will open up and realize how serious this situation truly is.
  By informing the public about the different types of child abuse that many don't know about or consider one. An example of a 
  neglected form of child abuse is verbal/emotional child abuse. If the public knows about this form of child abuse maybe there 
  will be more instances where a child is saved from this form of child abuse before it affects them.</ul>
